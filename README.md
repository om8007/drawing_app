# drawing_app

Drawing App in Flutter.

## Expected Functionality
- To let users select defferent pen color from ColorChoser Widget
- As long as pen color is not changed all drawing should be in same color
- With new pen color chosen, the previous drawing should retain their original color
- As soon as drawing starts, ColorChoser gets hidden and on complete, ColorChoser is visible again
- Undo FAB click removes the last draw

## Issues
- In first draw, the line is not shown as soon as drawn
- The drawing is laggy, i.e line is not drawn as fast as pen moves
